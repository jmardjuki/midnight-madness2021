"Still no gift in sight or mind, Jasper plodded past Everett's wagon. "Step right up!" gushed the salesman. "I've got beautiful blooms and fantastic flowers!"
But all of the raccoon's flowers had wilted from the cold. None of them matched the beauty Jasper had in mind for Lilly.
Jasper was worried. It was getting late, and he still had nothing for Lilly. "Jasper!" called Teagan. "What are you doing out on this cold, snowy Valentine's Day?" "I'm searching for a gift for Lilly." Jasper replied," but I don't know what to do." "Come in and we'll brainstorm by the fire." Teagan said warmly.
I do understand." Teagan said. "I myself have been hunting all day for a Valentine's gift to impress my vixen, Faith. And I think rabbit stew is just the ticket!"
Before Jasper knew it, he was in the soup!
"Terrified, Jasper waiter for his chance. When Teagan walked away to pull out Faith's chair, Jasper sprang out of the pot and escaped, quick as a bunny.
Jasper was wet and cold and ready to give up when Spalding called down. "This necklace of winter berries will make a wonderful Valentine's gift for my mate, don't you think, Jasper?"
"Yes, it's a splending gift." said Jasper sadly. "But I have nothing for Lilly. I have been around the entire valley, and I can't give her a handmade sacrf or wilter flowers or chocolate flies or any goft at all if I become rabbit stew!"
The cardinal looked thoughtful, "Hmm... no gift, you say? From where I sit I see you have given Lilly a wonderful gift already."
Back at the burrow, Lilly stepped outside to wait for Jasper. She saw the heart he had made for her...
.. and she loved it.
Jasper's journey showed the greatest gift he could give: his love for her.
